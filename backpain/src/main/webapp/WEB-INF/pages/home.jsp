																	<br> <b>CALBA - COMPUTER-ASSISTED LOW BACK
																			ASSESSMENT</b><br> <br> There are many types of
																				low back pain. Herniated disk (‘slipped disk’) is
																				one of the most common. Herniated disk often heals
																				spontaneously but sometimes requires surgery. It can
																				be exacerbated by various activities, including
																				certain remedial exercises and yoga postures. Early
																				detection and appropriate management of herniated
																				disk can probably improve the prospects of recovery
																				and avoidance of long-term chronic low back pain.
																				The most common age range for herniated disc to
																				first emerge is 25 – 45 years, so this is the ideal
																				time to catch it <br> <br> CALBA can help
																						you determine whether your low back pain involves
																						a herniated disk. To obtain a CALBA assessment you
																						enrol (above right) and answer six, short
																						questionnaires, which cover a wide range of
																						factors bearing on herniated disc. CALBA processes
																						the data to help assess the likelihood of
																						herniated disk and its current stage of healing. A
																						low back pain specialist then completes the
																						assessment and prepares a report on your condition
																						along with advice on precautions, lifestyle, and
																						therapeutic exercises. It takes about 20 minutes
																						to answer the questionnaires and up to 2 working
																						days for the report to be prepared and emailed to
																						you. Your CALBA Assessment Report will include an optional donation form for contributing towards the cost and further development of this service.

																	<br> <b>HERNIATED DISK</b> <br>
																			<h3>
																				<b>Summary</b>
																			</h3> Acute herniated disk often leads to nerve trapping
																			and sciatica (pain in your leg). However, not all
																			sciatica is caused by herniated disk, and not all
																			herniated disks cause sciatica. Moreover, during
																			recovery from a herniated disk with associated
																			sciatica, there is a period during which there is no
																			longer any leg pain but the disk is not fully healed.
																			Precautions should continue to be taken over this
																			period to reduce the likelihood of relapse. CALBA
																			helps to distinguish herniated disk from other forms
																			of sciatica and low back pain. It also distinguishes
																			different stages of recovery from herniated disk.
																			This is the basis for its advice on precautions,
																			therapeutic exercises and yoga postures. <br>
																				<h3>
																					<b>Anatomy, physiology and pathology</b>
																				</h3> When a disc herniates, its outer ring of tough
																				cartilage bulges and breaks, and the inner core,
																				composed of a thick gel, squeezes out through the
																				gap. This can impinge on a nerve root, causing pain,
																				numbness and/or weakness. A herniated disk in the
																				lower spine can trap a root of the sciatic nerve,
																				causing sciatica, a pain shooting along a
																				clearly-defined track down the back of the leg to
																				the foot. It may be accompanied by numbness and
																				muscle weakness. <br> <img id="ImageHarni1"
																					src="images/harni1.PNG"

																							<i>view of two lumbar vertebrae, with the
																								disk between them. The disk consists of an outer
																								ring of very strong cartilage (annulus fibrosus)
																								and an inner core of thick gel (nucleus
																								pulposus). The disks provide flexibility to the
																								spine and act as shock absorbers: when pressure
																								is exerted on the spine, the disks bulge out,
																								like a bicycle tyre when you ride on it.</i> <br>
																								<br> <img id="ImageHerni2"
																									src="images/harni2.PNG"
																									style="width: 698px; border-width: 0px;">
																										<br> <i>A normal disk has a
																												continuous ring of the annulus around its
																												nucleus. In contrast a herniated disk has a
																												rift in the annulus, through which part of
																												the nucleus protrudes. The disc protrusion
																												may impinge on the root of a nerve going
																												from the spine to another part of the body,
																												as shown in this cross section through a
																												herniated disk. Trapping of the nerve root
																												causes shooting pain along the path of that
																												nerve, numbness at the nerve endings and
																												weakness in muscles served by that nerve. </i> <br>
																												<br> Herniated discs often heal
																													spontaneously, given favourable conditions.
																													The bulge contracts and gradually hardens,
																													sealing the break in the ring of cartilage
																													(like scar tissue in a wound). <br> <br>
																															The shooting pain and other symptoms
																															disappear, when the bulge has retracted
																															far enough to cease disturbing the nerve
																															root. A more localised pain in the region
																															of the disc usually persists for a time,
																															often accompanied by a diffuse pain in
																															the buttock and back of the thigh. This
																															also can disappear, leaving the back pain
																															free, if the healing goes to completion.
																															<br> <br> It is useful to
																																	distinguish five phases in the healing
																																	process: <br> <br> <b>1.
																																				Acute Phase: </b>Severe sciatic pain,
																																			curtailing most activities except
																																			lying on your back. In its first
																																			episode this often lasts only a few
																																			hours or days. If it persists more
																																			than four weeks, there is a danger
																																			that it will damage the nerves and
																																			official medical guidelines recommend
																																			referral to a specialist. <br> <br>
																																					<b>2. Early Recovery Phase:</b> The
																																					sciatica is intermittent and
																																					becomes progressively less frequent
																																					and less severe. This phase usually
																																					lasts a few days or weeks. <br>
																																						<br> <b>3. Middle
																																								Recovery Phase:</b> The sciatica
																																							disappears, leaving pain in the
																																							lower back, accompanied sometimes
																																							by diffuse pain in the buttock
																																							and back of the thigh. This is
																																							known as ‘referred pain’ and is
																																							not due to trapping of the
																																							sciatic nerve. This phase can
																																							last a few weeks or months. <br>
																																								<br> <b>4. Late
																																										Recovery Phase:</b> All pain has
																																									gone but the healing is not yet
																																									complete. There is no
																																									definitive evidence as to how
																																									long this phase lasts but we
																																									recommend allowing at least six
																																									months for it to reach
																																									completion. <br> <br>
																																											<b>5. Remission:</b> The
																																											healing process has
																																											successfully completed and
																																											normal activities can be
																																											resumed. <br> <br>

																	<br> <b>TREATMENT</b> <br> <br> A
																				relapse can occur throughout the healing process but
																				the risk progressively diminishes as the disc
																				strengthens. In the <b>Early Recovery Phase</b> even
																				gentle movements can bring on the sciatic pain,
																				while in the <b>Middle Recovery Phase</b> many
																				normal activities can be resumed with care. In the <b>Late
																					Recovery Phase</b> there is a temptation to resume even
																				strong activities, because the pain has gone, but
																				this is risky because the disc is still at
																				heightened risk of herniation. <br> <br>
																						On its first occurrence, a herniation is often
																						small and can heal successfully if given the right
																						conditions. With each successive recurrence, the
																						break in the disk can become more established, so
																						that repair becomes more difficult and takes
																						longer. It is important to take care even during
																						the <b>Late Recovery Phase</b>, when you are
																						tempted to ‘overdo it’ because there is no pain to
																						warn you of the risk. <br> <br> We
																								recommend you to be careful for at least six
																								months from the time when the pain has ceased.
																								After that you can resume practically all your
																								normal activities, provided you take care and
																								feel no pain or discomfort. Some people who have
																								had a herniated disc report a feeling of
																								vulnerability in the spine when they
																								over-challenge it. This can be a valuable
																								warning signal to be careful.
																								<h3>
																									<b>Lifestyle</b>
																								</h3> In our experience healing of a herniated disc
																								can be aided by lifestyle changes, coupled with
																								therapeutic exercises. <br> <br> Our
																										policy is to reduce as much as possible those
																										activities, which unduly stress the disc, so
																										as to allow healing to take place without
																										relapse. Pain reminds you to do this during
																										the initial acute phase, and also during the
																										following period when the shooting pain recurs
																										with activities that strain the disc. But as
																										the healing progresses, the disc becomes more
																										resilient and causes less pain. There comes a
																										time when all pain has ceased but the disc is
																										still at risk. You should be careful during
																										this period not fully to resume normal
																										activities until healing is completed. We
																										recommend continuing to be careful for at
																										least six months after the pain has completely
																										disappeared, gradually and carefully resuming
																										your full range of activities. Activities
																										which challenge discs include: <br> <br>
																												• Bending forwards or sideways<br> •
																													Twisting<br> • Vacuum cleaning<br>
																															• Lifting<br> • Carrying heavy
																																weights<br> • Long sitting in
																																	certain positions<br> • Long
																																		driving<br> • Sports involving
																																			unilateral actions, e.g. tennis,
																																			squash, golf, cricket<br> •
																																				Violent sports, e.g. football <br>
																																					<br> Sitting is worse for a
																																						herniated disc than standing,
																																						especially when slumping. So avoid
																																						sitting in easy chairs where your
																																						back is rounded. Both at home and
																																						at work, use chairs that encourage
																																						your lower back to be concave. At
																																						home, lying in a prone position
																																						can be useful when you are
																																						reading, talking or watching TV. <br>
																																							<h3>
																																								<b>Yoga Therapy </b>
																																							</h3> There are various systems of
																																							therapeutic exercise for low back
																																							pain, including those of
																																							physiotherapy, Pilates and yoga.
																																							Whichever system you use, it is
																																							important to take the precautions
																																							outlined above, if you have a
																																							herniated disc. We focus here on
																																							yoga therapy. <br> <br>
																																									An ordinary yoga class can
																																									seriously worsen a herniated
																																									disc, because it includes
																																									forward bends, side bends and
																																									other postures that place
																																									pressure on the discs. In
																																									contrast yoga therapy tailored
																																									for herniated discs is safe and
																																									beneficial. Yoga can help the
																																									healing process in the
																																									following ways: <br> <br>
																																											• Gently mobilising joints -
																																											thus promoting repair and
																																											maintenance<br> <br>
																																													• Relaxing tense muscles -
																																													thus enhancing restorative
																																													blood flow to damaged
																																													tissues and washing away
																																													pain-causing substances
																																													from the affected area<br>
																																														<br> • Strengthening
																																															core muscles, and
																																															improving muscle control
																																															- thus improving posture
																																															and helping protect the
																																															spine<br> <br>
																																																	• Heightening body
																																																	awareness and reducing
																																																	fear - thus
																																																	facilitating
																																																	identification of body
																																																	positions that are
																																																	pain-free and devising
																																																	of ways avoid (or
																																																	modify) positions that
																																																	cause pain<br> <br>
																																																			Various different
																																																			selections of yoga
																																																			practices can be used
																																																			as therapy for people
																																																			with herniated disc.
																																																			We use a sequence
																																																			designed by Professor
																																																			D. Dongaonkar, a
																																																			distinguished
																																																			orthopaedic surgeon,
																																																			who also introduced
																																																			us to the assessment
																																																			procedure, from which
																																																			CALBA emerged. The
																																																			Dongaonkar Sequence
																																																			is particularly good
																																																			for people with
																																																			herniated disc
																																																			because it uses
																																																			exercises which are
																																																			mainly in supine and
																																																			prone positions, thus
																																																			taking weight off the
																																																			disks. <br> <br>

																																				This workshop is intended for yoga
																																				teachers who have students with low
																																				back pain, or who have low back
																																				pain, themselves. It focuses on
																																				herniated disk, a condition, with
																																				serious risks. <br> <br>
																																						Herniated disk, also known as <i>prolapsed
																																							disk or slipped disk</i>, is common
																																						in the age range 30-50 years.
																																						Acute herniated disk often leads
																																						to nerve trapping and sciatica
																																						(shooting pain in leg). However,
																																						not all sciatica is caused by
																																						herniated disk, and not all
																																						herniated disks cause sciatica.
																																						Moreover, during recovery from a
																																						herniated disk with associated
																																						sciatica, there are periods of
																																						several months or more, during
																																						which there is no longer any leg
																																						pain but the disk is not fully
																																						healed. If suitable precautions
																																						are not taken over these periods,
																																						there is increased risk of
																																						recurring episodes, and the
																																						development of chronic conditions,
																																						which may require surgery or lead
																																						to disabilities. <br> <br>
																																								Certain yoga practices can
																																								exacerbate herniated disk.
																																								Contrary to a common
																																								misconception, ‘working through
																																								the pain’ worsens the condition,
																																								rather than helps. Some people
																																								who practise yoga are
																																								perpetuating their herniated
																																								disk, while others stop doing
																																								yoga because it hurts. If
																																								suitable precautions were taken,
																																								both could practise yoga safely
																																								and with therapeutic benefits. <br>
																																									<br> This workshop will
																																										empower yoga teachers to (a)
																																										ascertain whether a person
																																										with LBP is likely to have
																																										herniated disk, (b) judge
																																										whether it is safe to take
																																										them in their yoga classes and
																																										(if it is) what precautions to
																																										take, and (c) judge when to
																																										refer them to a specialist
																																										yoga therapist or medical
																																										doctor. <br> <br>
																																												The workshop will include
																																												sessions on herniated disk,
																																												as follows: <br> <br>
																																														• Anatomy and physiology<br>
																																															• Natural history<br>
																																																• Assessment<br> •
																																																	Medical treatments<br>
																																																		• General yoga and
																																																		yoga therapy<br>
																																																			• Lifestyle<br>
																																																				<br> <br>
																																																						Participants will

																																																						CALBA, our new
																																																						Internet-based

																																																						it easy for yoga
																																																						teachers to
																																																						distinguish
																																																						herniated disk
																																																						from other types

																	<br> <b>RESEARCH</b> <br> <br> CALBA is
																				based on standard, medical procedures for diagnosis
																				of low back pain, as taught to us by the
																				distinguished orthopaedic surgeon, Professor D
																				Dongaonkar, Emeritus Head of Orthopaedics at Grant
																				Medical College, Mumbai, India. Dongaonkar had
																				developed a system of yoga therapy for low back
																				pain, through which he had saved many of his
																				patients from surgery. We have been using
																				Dongaonkar’s methods for treating low back pain
																				since 1995. In parallel with providing yoga therapy
																				for hundreds of people with low back pain, we have
																				developed CALBA, and tested it against Dongaonkar’s
																				assessment procedures. We are currently planning a
																				controlled trial further to validate CALBA using MRI
																				scanning to confirm the presence of herniated disk.
																				<br> <br> Several research trials have
																						been published on yoga for low back pain, all of
																						which have shown significant improvements in the
																						condition (links to extracts). However, these
																						excluded herniated disk. To date, no trials have
																						been published on yoga for herniated disk. We
																						therefore have to rely on the experience of yoga
																						therapists and teachers who have worked with this
																						condition. Among the most substantial evidence of
																						this kind is that of Dongaonkar, who successfully
																						used yoga therapy for treating hundreds of
																						patients with serious low back pain. Another
																						orthopaedic surgeon, Art Brownstein, successfully
																						treated his own herniated disk with yoga and went
																						on to became a professional yoga therapist,
																						specialising in low back pain. His experience and
																						methods are described in his well-known book,
																						Healing Back Pain Naturally ( 1999. Gig Harbor,
																						WA: Harbor Press Inc.). We have, ourselves,
																						provided yoga therapy for hundreds of people with
																						herniated disk, with virtually no adverse effects
																						and often substantial improvements. <br>
